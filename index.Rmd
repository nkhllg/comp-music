## Welcome to Computational Musicology 2024!

Welcome to Computational Musicology 2024! This storyboard contains further examples from each week to inspire you.

You can access the lecture notes at the following links.

### Visualising the AI Song Contest

```{r}
```


### Including Plots -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
